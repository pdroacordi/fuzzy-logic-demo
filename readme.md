# Fuzzy Logic Tip Calculator

This repository provides an interactive Jupyter Notebook for learning the basics of fuzzy logic by building a simple tip calculator. The calculator determines whether a tip should be low, medium, or high based on the quality of the food and service.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of fuzzy logic in a real-world scenario. Using fuzzy logic, this tip calculator evaluates the quality of food and quality of service as inputs and returns a tip amount as low, medium, or high. This project is perfect for beginners who want to understand the fundamentals of fuzzy logic in a hands-on manner.
